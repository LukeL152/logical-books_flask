# Budgeting Guide

This guide explains how to use the budgeting features in Logical Books to manage your finances and track your spending.

## Creating a Budget

To create a new budget, navigate to the **Budget** page from the main menu. Here, you will find a form to add a new budget.

### Budget Fields

*   **Name:** A descriptive name for your budget (e.g., "Monthly Groceries," "Marketing Expenses").
*   **Category:** Assign one or more categories to your budget. The budget will track all transactions assigned to these categories.
*   **Parent Budget:** You can create hierarchical budgets by assigning a parent budget. The spending of child budgets will roll up to the parent budget.
*   **Keywords:** In addition to categories, you can track spending based on keywords found in the transaction description.
*   **Amount:** The total amount you want to budget for the specified period.
*   **Period:** The budget period can be monthly, quarterly, or yearly.
*   **Start Date:** The date when the budget becomes active.

## Analyzing Your Budgets

The **Budget** page provides an overview of all your budgets, including the budgeted amount, actual spending, and the remaining balance.

For a more detailed analysis, you can click the "Analyze" button next to any budget. This will take you to the **Budget Analysis** page, where you can find:

*   **Performance Over Time:** A chart showing your historical spending against your budget.
*   **Spending Breakdown:** A pie chart that breaks down your spending by category.
*   **Contributing Transactions:** A list of all the transactions that have contributed to the budget's spending for the selected period.
