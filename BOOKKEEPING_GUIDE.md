## What is GAAP?

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are a common set of accounting principles, standards, and procedures issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Public companies in the U.S. must follow GAAP for their financial reporting. While not always mandatory for small private businesses, adhering to GAAP is a best practice that ensures clarity, consistency, and comparability of financial information. It is essential if you plan to seek funding from investors or apply for loans.

The primary goal of GAAP is to ensure a company's financial statements are **complete**, **consistent**, and **comparable**.

## Core GAAP Principles

These are the underlying principles that guide accounting practices. Understanding them is the first step to proper bookkeeping.

| Principle | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Economic Entity** | Your business is a separate entity from you personally. Business finances must be kept entirely separate from personal finances. |
| **Monetary Unit** | All financial activity is recorded in a single, stable currency (e.g., U.S. Dollars). |
| **Time Period** | A business's financial life can be broken down into specific time periods (e.g., month, quarter, year) for reporting. |
| **Cost Principle** | Assets should be recorded at their original purchase cost, not their current market value. |
| **Full Disclosure** | All information that could affect a reader's understanding of the financial statements must be disclosed, often in footnotes. |
| **Going Concern** | Assumes the business will remain in operation for the foreseeable future, not that it will be liquidated. |
| **Matching Principle** | Expenses must be "matched" to the revenues they helped generate and recorded in the same accounting period. |
| **Revenue Recognition** | Revenue is recorded when it is *earned*, not necessarily when the cash is received. |
| **Materiality** | Allows accountants to disregard trivial matters, but requires tracking any transaction that is "material" (large enough to influence decisions). |
| **Conservatism** | When there are two acceptable ways to record a transaction, the one that is less likely to overstate assets or income should be chosen. |

## The Fundamental Accounting Equation

All of bookkeeping is built upon this simple equation. It must **always** be in balance.

> **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

-   **Assets:** What your company *owns* (e.g., cash, accounts receivable, equipment, inventory).
-   **Liabilities:** What your company *owes* to others (e.g., loans, accounts payable, wages payable).
-   **Equity:** The net worth of the company. It is the residual value after subtracting liabilities from assets (Equity = Assets - Liabilities). It represents the owners' stake in the company.

## Double-Entry Bookkeeping: Debits & Credits

To keep the accounting equation in balance, every transaction is recorded using a **double-entry system**. This means every entry has two parts: a **debit** and a **credit**.

-   A **debit** (Dr) is an entry on the left side of an account ledger.
-   A **credit** (Cr) is an entry on the right side of an account ledger.

**For every transaction, the total amount of debits must equal the total amount of credits.**

How debits and credits affect account balances depends on the account type:

| Account Type | To Increase Balance | To Decrease Balance | Normal Balance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Assets** | Debit | Credit | Debit |
| **Expenses** | Debit | Credit | Debit |
| **Liabilities** | Credit | Debit | Credit |
| **Equity** | Credit | Debit | Credit |
| **Revenue/Income** | Credit | Debit | Credit |

*Tip: The first two account types, **Assets** and **Expenses**, are increased with a Debit. The other three are increased with a Credit.*

**Example:** You buy a $500 computer (an Asset) with cash (also an Asset).
-   You *increase* the "Equipment" asset account with a **Debit** of $500.
-   You *decrease* the "Cash" asset account with a **Credit** of $500.
-   The equation remains in balance: Assets went up and down by the same amount.

## The Chart of Accounts

The **Chart of Accounts (CoA)** is a complete list of every account in your general ledger, organized by account type. It is the foundational structure for your bookkeeping system.

A typical CoA is structured as follows:

-   **1000s - Assets**
    -   1010: Cash
    -   1210: Accounts Receivable
    -   1510: Office Equipment
    -   1710: Inventory
-   **2000s - Liabilities**
    -   2010: Accounts Payable
    -   2210: Business Loan Payable
-   **3000s - Equity**
    -   3010: Owner's Capital
    -   3210: Retained Earnings
-   **4000s - Revenue/Income**
    -   4010: Product Sales
    -   4020: Service Income
-   **5000s - Expenses**
    -   5010: Rent Expense
    -   5020: Office Supplies
    -   5030: Salaries and Wages

## The Bookkeeping Cycle

Bookkeeping is a cyclical process. At the end of each accounting period (e.g., monthly), the following steps are performed:

1.  **Analyze Transactions:** Identify all financial transactions (invoices, receipts, payments) and determine their effect on the accounts.
2.  **Journalize Transactions:** Record each transaction as a journal entry in chronological order. Each entry will have at least one debit and one credit.
3.  **Post to General Ledger:** Transfer the journal entries to the corresponding accounts in the General Ledger. The ledger shows the complete history and balance for each individual account.
4.  **Prepare an Unadjusted Trial Balance:** List all accounts and their balances. The total of all debit balances must equal the total of all credit balances. If they don't, there is an error that must be found.
5.  **Record Adjusting Entries:** Make entries for transactions that are not yet recorded, such as accrued expenses or earned revenue. This is critical for complying with the Matching and Revenue Recognition principles. Common examples include depreciation and accruals.
6.  **Prepare an Adjusted Trial Balance:** After posting adjusting entries, a new trial balance is prepared to ensure it still balances.
7.  **Prepare Financial Statements:** Use the adjusted trial balance to create the primary financial statements:
    -   **Income Statement:** Shows revenues and expenses over a period of time (Revenues - Expenses = Net Income).
    -   **Balance Sheet:** Shows assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time (Assets = Liabilities + Equity).
    -   **Statement of Cash Flows:** Shows how cash moved in and out of the company from operating, investing, and financing activities.
8.  **Closing the Books:** "Close" the temporary accounts (Revenue, Expenses) by transferring their balances to a permanent equity account (like Retained Earnings). This resets the temporary accounts to zero for the next accounting period.
9.  **Prepare a Post-Closing Trial Balance:** A final trial balance is prepared, showing only the permanent accounts (Assets, Liabilities, Equity), to ensure the books are balanced and ready for the new period.

## Practical Bookkeeping with Logical Books

This application is designed to help you follow the bookkeeping cycle.

-   **Chart of Accounts:** Use the `/accounts` page to set up your Chart of Accounts. Define each account with the correct type (Asset, Liability, Equity, Income, Expense).
-   **Journalize Transactions:** Use the `/journal` page to add new entries. The application enforces the double-entry system, ensuring that for each transaction, your debits equal your credits.
-   **General Ledger:** The `/ledger` page functions as your General Ledger, allowing you to see all transactions for a specific account and its running balance.
-   **Adjusting Entries:** At the end of a period, you can record adjusting entries (like depreciation or accruals) directly in the journal. The `/accruals` and `/fixed_assets` features are specifically designed to help automate these.
-   **Financial Statements:** The application automatically generates the key financial statements based on your journal entries:
    -   `/income_statement`
    -   `/balance_sheet`
    -   `/statement_of_cash_flows`
-   **Closing the Books:** While the app doesn't have an automated "closing" button, the process is managed by using the date filters on the financial statements. You can run an Income Statement for a specific period (e.g., a year), and the net income from that statement is the amount that would be transferred to Retained Earnings in a manual closing process.
